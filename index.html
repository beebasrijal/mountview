                        Practical knowledge has been a must in the recent time.
                        We offer our students separate laboratory rooms for
                        different subjects. We have a full-fledged computer lab
                        with a proper internet connection. We also have a
                        fully-equiped physics, chemistry and biology
                        laboratories.

                    Mount View English Boarding School has always been at the
                    forefront of education in terms of quality education. Our
                    students have gone forth and excelled in various fields
                    nationally and internationally. This has been made possible
                    with the blessings of our elders, visionary members of the
                    school managing committee, supportive parents and dedicated
                    staff who have relentlessly strived to deliver quality
                    education. Since its inception, we have always been
                    committed to providing high quality education that
                    emphasizes not only gaining knowledge but also focuses on
                    the students’ holistic development. For its continuous
                    improvement, we listen and respond to parents’ concerns and
                    needs of a changing society. Our child-centred approach to
                    teaching and learning at the primary level has become
                    successful in terms of the overall development of the
                    children. We reiterate our commitment to provide a nurturing
                    environment and every facility possible to ensure a high
                    quality education every student deserves in today’s
                    globalized world. We hope to provide you with some useful
                    information about our school and basic information about
                    your children e.g exam result and fee details. Wholesome
                    participation is encouraged to ensure the well-being and
                    happiness of each and every student in our school.
